# 2022 Advent of Code
Source control for Advent of Code 2022

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate potential solutions to the 2022 Advent of Code challenges using Python (and potentially other languages) as well.  These files are only posted after all global leaderboard points have been awarded.  This is not saying these solutions are the ONLY ones, nor are they even the BEST ones.

## Who is this for?
Anyone who is looking to better understand basic python syntax and using python to solve simple challenges with base python modules (os, string, json, etc.).  I do not claim to be a master of python, so bring on the challenges/questions/feedback as you will!

## Why do this?
While the purpose of this repository is to demonstrate solutions of the 2022 Advent of Code challenges, it is a personal mission of mine to become a more dedicated developer/programmer.  Participating in daily challenges and using the "tools of the trade" such as git on a regular basis will help build on existing skillsets.

## How does it work?
All of the solutions in this repository are built with python 3.8.10 on ubuntu.  Follow these steps to execute these solutions:
1. Install python 3.8.10 or later
2. Copy the solution file and your user specific input (in a file named input.txt) to the same directory<br>
project_directory<br>
-- solution.py<br>
-- input.txt
3. Change your working directory to the directory containing your solution.py and input.txt files
  - Linux: cd /home/username/my/project/directory
  - Windows: cd C:\users\username\my\project\directory)
4. Run the python solution
  - Linux: python3 solution.py
  - Windows: python solution.py
  
The solution files are designed to read the raw text input copied entirely from the AdventOfCode site. Do not modify the raw content when creating the input.txt file.
